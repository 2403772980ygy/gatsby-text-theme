# [WIP]gatsby-TeXt-theme

## Important note: This is NOT a gatsby theme, it is a blog theme

[jekyll-text-theme](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-text-theme) is my favorite jekyll theme.

And I need some front end practise.

So this project is created.

I'm trying to preserve most of the "original" code and replace some with javascript libraries.

Make sure to check [jekyll-text-theme](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-text-theme) out! Its an amazing theme overall!

## Contributing

I'm new to gatsby and front-end development, feel free to correct my mistakes and submit issues and pull requests!
